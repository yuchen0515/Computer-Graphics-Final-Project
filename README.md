## Project Requirement

### Required User Interaction: (30%)
- [x] One of the 3D objects is the ”player”. Users can **move** the player and **rotate** the player by themouse and keyboard.
- [x] By default, your camera should move/rotate along with the ”player”.  This is so called the first person view angle.
- [x] Allow users to switch between the **first person view angle** and the **third** person view angle (by pressing the mouse button or a key). The third person view angle can be just a fixed camera position which can cover most of the region of your scene.

### Technical Requirements: (35%)
- [x] 1  **point  light**  and  implement  the  **local  illumination**  (ambient+difusse+specular  and  phongshading)
- [x] At least, 1 of the **3D** objects with **nice texture mapping**
- [x] Use an environment **cube map** to have the environment background
- [x] Make some of your objects **keep moving or rotating.**
- [x] At the bottom of your webpage, write some texts to shortly introduce your work and tell usershow to play your work

### Options (35%)
- [ ] shadow
- [x] cube map reflection/refraction
- [x] dynamic reflection
- [ ] bump mapping
> * You should implement at least 2 of them.
> * If you implement 1 more function,  you will receive 5% extra bonus.  If you implement 2 morefunctions, you will receive 10% extra bonus.
